<h1>Mission Statement</h1>

<p>My student portfolio showcases my journey. Reflects my strong dedication, to learning, personal growth and knowledge.
     It demonstrates my commitment to excellence. Highlights the diverse range of learning experiences I have had. As I put together this portfolio I aim not to showcase my curiosity and love for learning but 
     also to reflect on how my skills have developed over time and acknowledge my achievements.This portfolio serves as a living record of who I'm as a learner showcasing how I have overcome challenges, 
     honed thinking skills and adapted to new environments. It acts as a roadmap, for my aspirations motivating me to continuously expand my knowledge and embrace future opportunities.</p>
