                     <h1>Biography</h1>

                   <p>My name is Claude Kangni. I am a second year student at KSU and 
                    I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Technology. I am a kind-hearted person who 
                    likes to watch movies and hang out with friends. My goals are to graduate college with a 3.8 GPA and 
                    hopefully receive a job in cybersecurity. </p>
